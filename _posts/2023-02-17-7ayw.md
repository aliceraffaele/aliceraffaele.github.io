The [7th AIROYoung Workshop](https://ayw2023.di.unimi.it) has just ended, and we of [AIROYoung](https://www.airoyoung.org) could not be happier.

From Wednesday 15th to Friday 17th, 67 PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and practitioners attended the workshop this year at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Milan, Italy. 81% of the participants were from Italy, whereas the others came from Austria, France, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, and the USA.

In this edition, we had two plenary sessions (by Prof. Paolo Boldi and Prof. Claudia D'Ambrosio), 39 in-person contributed talks, 4 industrial talks, and two social events (an exhibition at the Leonardo3 Museum and a social dinner at Casa Lodi).

The conference proceedings will be published in a volume in the [AIRO Springer Series](https://www.springer.com/series/15947).

The 7AYW would not have been possible without the support of our sponsors: [AIRO](https://www.airo.org), [Multiprotexion](https://www.multiprotexion.com), [OPTIT S.r.l.](https://www.optit.net/en/), [Laife Reply](https://www.reply.com/laife-reply/en/), [Target Reply](https://www.reply.com/target-reply/it/), [OptRail](http://www.optrail.com), and [S2E Business & Technology Consultants](https://solutions2enterprises.com).

We are grateful to the Local Committee of the University of Milan: Michele Barbato, Alberto Boggio, Rosario Messana, Cristina Ondei, and Matteo Premoli.
