The [9th AIROYoung Workshop](https://mate.unipv.it/ayw2025/) has come to an end. This edition was in the beautiful Pavia, a crossroads of many scientific, humanistic, and cultural figures and paths, and now also of the 112 participants of this edition. Seeing this community continue to grow, year after year, and renew itself in the process, is impressive and heart-warming.

Tessitore) for organizing the event.
