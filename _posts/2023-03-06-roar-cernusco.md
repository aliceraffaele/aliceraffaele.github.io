At the beginning of February 2023, Alessandro Gobbi, Gabriella Colajanni, and I started a training course at the ITSOS Marie Curie Higher Secondary Education Institute in Cernusco sul Naviglio (Milan, Italy).

A dozen mathematics and informatics teachers of the Institute attended the course, which is based on the [materials](https://github.com/aliceraffaele/ROAR) of the first two teaching units of [ROAR](https://sites.google.com/view/progettoroar/).

In particular, the course is composed of the following five meetings:

1) February 02: “*Introduction to operations research, optimization, and Linear Programming, and resolution of two-variable Linear Programming problems*” by Alessandro Gobbi;

2) February 10: “*Introduction to Integer Linear Programming and Mixed Integer Linear Programming, and solving optimization problems with more than two variables with Solver, a Microsoft Excel add-on*”, by Gabriella Colajanni;

3) February 21: “*Introduction to graph theory: application to social networks and network optimization problems*” by myself;

4) 06 March: “*The birth of graph theory: the problem of the seven bridges of Königsberg*” by myself;

5) 30 May: report of activities carried out in class by the teachers.
