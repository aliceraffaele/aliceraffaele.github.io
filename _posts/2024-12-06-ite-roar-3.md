The last article describing the third and last unit of the ROAR project has been published today on INFORMS Transactions on Education and is available at this [link](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ited.2023.0065).

Grade-12 students learned how to (i) code models in Python, (ii) solve them with PuLP, and (iii) face a (simplified) industrial case from [FILTREC S.p.A.](https://www.filtrec.com), an Italian filter manufacturer known worldwide for the production and distribution of hydraulic filters.

We thank Prof. Marinella Picchi, her students, and the director of [IIS Antonietti](https://antoniettiseo.edu.it) in Iseo (Brescia, Italy) for their willingness to host the teaching experiment; Emanuele Giliani, Filtrec’s operations manager, as well as all other company representatives and employees, for collaborating in developing the final project of ROAR III; and Stefano Bortolomiol, for his seminar and related activities during one of the lectures.

ROAR has been developed with Alessandro Gobbi, Eugenia Taranto, Gabriella Colajanni, and Marinella Picchi. The first implementation of the three-year version was carried out at IIS Antonietti in Iseo (Brescia, Italy) with about 20-25 students from when they were in Grade 10 until the end of their high school path as Grade 12.
