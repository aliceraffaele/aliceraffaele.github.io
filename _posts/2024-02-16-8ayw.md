The [8th AIROYoung Workshop](https://www.unical.it/ayw2024/) has just ended, and we of [AIROYoung](https://airoyoung.airo.org) are very enthusiastic and proud of how it went! Indeed, more than 70 Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and practitioners attended the workshop at the University of Calabria, from Wednesday February 14th to Friday 16th.

In this edition, we had three plenary sessions (by Prof. Manlio Gaudioso, Prof. Daniele Vigo, and Prof. Claudio Sterle), 43 in-person contributed talks, three industrial talks, two social events (a Calabrian dinner and a Cosenza tour followed by a social dinner), and our traditional [AIROYoung meeting](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7mdopwa6z1egyovlr669p/8AYW_AIROYoungMeeting-OKAY.pdf?rlkey=jshtdlg9dsl0yfmo074dm9ksi&dl=0).

The conference proceedings will be published in a volume in the [AIRO Springer Series](https://www.springer.com/series/15947) together with the proceedings of the [7th AIROYoung Workshop](https://ayw2023.di.unimi.it).
