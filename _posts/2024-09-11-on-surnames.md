I have translated the column I originally wrote for [MaddMaths!](https://maddmaths.simai.eu/comunicare/pari-opportunita/euro-gold-medal-2024-a-maria-grazia-speranza-di-cognomi-simboli-e-mete/) about the [EURO Gold Medal 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURO_Gold_Medal) awarded to [M. Grazia Speranza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Grazia_Speranza) and her latest book. You can find it now in the [latest issue](https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2024.03.05/full/) of [INFORMS OR/MS Today](https://pubsonline.informs.org/magazine/orms-today). Thanks to Kara Tucker for the editorial support.
