*Banco di prova* is an initiative funded by [Comune di Chiari](https://www.comune.chiari.brescia.it) and [Oratorio CG 2000](https://www.cg2000.it) to divulge STEM disciplines.
Together with Davide Capoferri (Ph.D. in Biotechnology) and Giovanni Macetti (Ph.D. in Chemistry), we developed a learning path composed of nine meetings addressed to primary and secondary school students. We explored some topics from mathematics, informatics, biology, chemistry, and science in general.
We always tried to adopt a playful approach by applying active learning, games, and collaborative learning.

In particular, I held the following activities:
  - November 14, 2022: the Caesar Cipher and other secret languages;
  - December 19, 2022: the Christmas (Knapsack) problem and an innovative bingo;
  - January 09, 2023: the algorithm behind cooking pasta and sorting games with numbers and heights.
