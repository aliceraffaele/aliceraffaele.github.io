*[KidsUniversity Verona](http://kidsuniversityverona.it)* is an annual initiative organized by the University of Verona which, by means of lectures, laboratories, workshops, and events, involves children and teachers of primary and secondary schools, as well as families, institutions, and companies. The main objectives are scientific dissemination and public engagement.
