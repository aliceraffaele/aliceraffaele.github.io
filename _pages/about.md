“*Who are we, who is each one of us, if not a combinatoria of experiences, information, books we have read, things imagined? Each life is an encyclopedia, a library, an inventory of objects, a series of styles, and everything can be constantly shuffled and reordered in every way conceivable.*”

Italo Calvino, “*Multiplicity*”, in “*Six memos for the next millennium*”





Ciao! Welcome to my website. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Mechanical, Energy, and Management Engineering](https://dimeg.unical.it/?lang=en) of the University of Calabria and a visiting researcher at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/home-page) of the University of Padova, working with Prof. Demetrio Laganà, Prof. Roberto Roberti, and Prof. Roberto Musmanno. I am also a contract professor in Operations Research at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.univr.it/?lang=en) of the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/home), Italy. Since February 2021, I have been one of the two joint coordinators of [AIROYoung](https://www.airoyoung.org), the Young Chapter of [AIRO](https://www.airo.org), i.e., the Italian Association of Operations Research.

After a scientific diploma in 2010, I first got a Bachelor's Degree (October 2013) and then a Master's Degree (March 2016), both in Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Brescia](https://www.unibs.it/en), Italy. From May 2016 until October 2017, I worked as an IT manager at [Edelweiss Energia S.p.A.](https://edelweiss-energia.it), an energy-trading company in Sarnico, Italy. I came back to academia in November 2017, when I enrolled in the [Ph.D. course in Mathematics](https://www.unitn.it/drmath/) jointly organized by [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en) and [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/home), Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Romeo Rizzi. In March 2022, I successfully defended my Ph.D. on enumeration problems. Right after, I started a postdoc on temporal networks, which lasted until March 2023.

Since 2018, I have gained experience in teaching several operations research courses at the University of Verona, and I also held some lectures in a scientific high school in Iseo (Brescia, Italy) to implement the [ROAR (Ricerca Operativa Applicazioni Reali)](https://github.com/aliceraffaele/ROAR) project.

Operations research has a manifold nature, and so am I. Beyond research and academia, I have several interests which I'd like to explore and cultivate as much as I can in my spare time. I enjoy a lot disseminating operations research to the public. For instance, since August 2021, I've been collaborating with [MaddMaths!](https://maddmaths.simai.eu/author/alice-raffaele/), the main Italian website for communicating mathematics. In 2017, given my deep love for reading, I founded a book club called [“I MiseraLibri”](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GruppoDiLetturaChiari), associated with the public library [Biblioteca comunale Fausto Sabeo](https://www.facebook.com/bibliochiari) in Chiari (Brescia, Italy). Since then, I have been organizing and coordinating more than 70 meetings (you can explore our “book map” [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1DofkuuHNFXbRL1pQStHPt37R76AAPcY&usp=sharing)), and four provincial and one national gathering of book clubs. I also like writing, practicing yoga, and cooking.
