Ciao! Welcome to my personal website. I am a postdoctoral researcher and a contract professor in Operations Research at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.univr.it/?lang=en) of the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/home), Italy. Since February 2021, I am also one of the two coordinators of [AIROYoung](https://www.airoyoung.org), the Young Chapter of [AIRO](https://www.airo.org), the Italian Association of Operations Research.

After a scientific diploma in 2010, I first got a Bachelor's Degree (October 2013) and then a Master's Degree (March 2016) both in Computer Science Engineering at the [University of Brescia](https://www.unibs.it/en), Italy. From May 2016 until October 2017, I worked as an IT manager in an energy-trading company named [Edelweiss Energia S.p.A.](https://edelweiss-energia.it), located in Sarnico, Italy. I came back to academia in November 2017, when I enrolled in the [Ph.D course in Mathematics](https://www.unitn.it/drmath/) jointly organized by the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en) and the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/home), Italy. In March 2022, I successfully defended my Ph.D on enumeration problems and right after I started my current postdoc on temporal networks.

In the last five years, I gained experience in teaching several operations-research courses at the University of Verona, and I also held some lectures in a scientific high-school in Iseo, Italy, in order to implement the [ROAR (Ricerca Operativa Applicazioni Reali)](https://github.com/aliceraffaele/ROAR) project.

Operations research has a manifold nature, and so am I. Beyond research and academia, I have several other interests, which I'd like to explore and cultivate as much as I can in my spare time. I enjoy a lot disseminating operations research to the public. For instance, since August 2021, I've been collaborating with [MaddMaths!](https://maddmaths.simai.eu/author/alice-raffaele/), the main Italian website to communicate mathematics. In 2017, given my deep love for reading, I founded a bookclub called [“I MiseraLibri”](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GruppoDiLetturaChiari), associated with the public library [Biblioteca comunale Fausto Sabeo](https://www.facebook.com/bibliochiari) in Chiari, Italy. Since then, I have been organizing and coordinating more than 70 meetings (you can explore our “book map” [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1DofkuuHNFXbRL1pQStHPt37R76AAPcY&usp=sharing)), and also four provincial and one national gatherings of bookclubs. I also like writing, practicing yoga, and cooking.
