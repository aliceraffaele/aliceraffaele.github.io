excerpt: 'Operations Research (OR) is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with optimization problems arising from different real contexts. The solving process of its problems is based on the construction and the resolution of mathematical models, showing the possible connections between mathematics and the real world. Nevertheless, OR is not typically included in most curricula of higher secondary schools (i.e., Grades 9--12), but it is usually presented mainly at university level. In order to show how OR could be significant for these school students' education, the authors of this paper developed an educational project consisting of three teaching units. In this paper, we share the result of the teaching experiment related to the first unit, addressed to Grade~10. Qualitative and quantitative analysis show how it is appropriate to include OR and its typology of problems in regular school mathematics lectures. Secondly, these data also show how modelling and problem-solving skills, developed working with OR, can be fostered by implementing a collaborative way of working, also by making use of digital technologies. Last but not least, we demonstrate the positive impact such activities have on students' appreciation of OR.'
